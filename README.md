# oblige-my-doom
A small windows batch script to launch your favorite DOOM source port with your favorite wads and a freshly generated Oblige map

Welcome to Oblige my Doom

This is a simple batch script that will generate an oblige map and launch it with your sourceport,
iwad and pwads of choice, given your prefered obligue configuration.

To use this script you must create a text file with the format used in Example.txt

Each line requires the specified path to the files in quotations.

For the pwads line, each pwad must be in quotations and separated by a space.

The oblige map will always be the first loaded pwad, keep that in mind.

To make your Oblige config file, you must run Oblige and go to Menu > Config Manager (F9)

Bear in mind that Oblige takes a while to generate a map, time depends on your Config file.

You may also drag your config file onto the batch to go directly to generating a map

For extra roguelite feel, we recommend closing your game on death and getting a new map.

Enjoy your Roguelite, Doomed Marines.

Cheers, Gabe
